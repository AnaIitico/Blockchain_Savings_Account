<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an application based on a Solidity smart contract that uses ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s features of a joint savings account. The smart contract accepts two addresses and only these addresses control the joint savings account. The account holders have the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account and the smart contract.

---

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples. -->

* [Solidity v0.5.0](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.0/)
* [Remix - Ethereum IDE](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

---

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

<!-- This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps. -->

I have placed Comments throughout the code so that you can follow the Lambda code and be able to replicate the app on your own. Also, so that you're able to contribute in the future :-)

---

### Prerequisites

<!-- This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them. -->
A text editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is not needed for this application.

You can build your smart contract directly on the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Make sure that you become familiar with the documentation for [Remix IDE](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [Solidity v5](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.0/) before you get started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AnaIitico/Blockchain_Savings_Account.git
   ```
